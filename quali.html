		<h2>E-MAIL SPAM DETECTION</h2>
		<p>e mailspam detection will ignore spam eails anf filter the proper mails using machine learning</p>
		<h2>EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS </h2>
		<p>In this project, we performed EDA on the   people's favorite car brand dataset which was collected by our team  using Python and the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. Our analysis revealed several insights into the structure of the data and the relationships between the variables. EDA is a crucial step in any data analysis project, as it helps to identify patterns and relationships that can inform further analysis and modeling.</p>
		<h2>ENERGY CONSERVATION USING PIEZOELECTRIC PLATES</h2>
		<p>In this project, we explored the use of piezoelectric plates to generate electrical energy from mechanical vibrations. Our experiments demonstrated that the system was able to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy, and that the output was influenced by several factors, including vibration frequency, amplitude, plate orientation, and plate location.

Piezoelectric materials have the potential to be used in a variety of applications for energy conservation, such as in sensors, actuators, and energy harvesters. Further research could explore the optimization of piezoelectric materials and systems for specific applications, as well as the integration of piezoelectric materials with other renewable energy sources.</p>
